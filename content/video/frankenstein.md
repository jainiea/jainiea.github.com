## SCENE 1 - THE DINNER DEBATE

### Part 1: William's Introduction - "Harvest attention"

Okay, let's stop before we even get to the main argument! This is William, Victor's brother, introducing the scene. And listen to his language—it's so clever!

He says: "Victor's always been one to harvest attention."

To harvest usually means to collect crops from a farm—you harvest wheat, you harvest corn. But here, William uses it metaphorically. He's saying Victor collects attention like a farmer collects crops. It's intentional, deliberate, almost greedy.

Notice he doesn't say "Victor likes attention" or "Victor wants attention." No! He says Victor harvests it—like it's his crop, his product, something he actively works to gather.

This is sophisticated vocabulary: taking a word from one context (farming) and applying it to human behavior (psychology). Native speakers do this all the time.

Practice: "She harvests compliments." "He harvests sympathy."
You can harvest anything intangible—attention, praise, drama, even pity.

Now, William continues: "Even as children, I mitigated his voice by staying silent."

Let's break this down. To mitigate means to make something less severe, less intense, less overwhelming. It's a formal, educated word:

"We need to mitigate the damage."  
"She mitigated the conflict by staying calm."

So William is saying: Victor was so LOUD, so attention-seeking, that the only way to balance it was for William to be silent. He reduced Victor's impact by disappearing.

But here's the sad part—listen to what he says next: "Perhaps too much and far too many times, wouldn't you say, Victor?"

Perhaps shows uncertainty, doubt.

Too much and far too many times—he's admitting he stayed silent when he should have spoken up. This is regret. He's saying, "Maybe I let you dominate too often. Maybe I should have challenged you more."

Then he adds: "wouldn't you say, Victor?"—he's asking Victor to agree with him, to acknowledge this pattern.

This is called a tag question, and we use it when we want confirmation or agreement:

"It's a beautiful day, wouldn't you say?"  
"That was unfair, wouldn't you say?"

But notice—William isn't really asking. He's making a statement disguised as a question. He's being indirect, polite, but also... a little passive-aggressive.

So in just three sentences, William has:

Described his brother's personality (attention harvester)  
Explained their childhood dynamic (loud Victor, silent William)  
Expressed regret for his own silence  
Challenged Victor indirectly

This is what we call subtext—the meaning beneath the words. On the surface, William sounds polite, even philosophical. But underneath? He's saying: "Victor, you've always been too much, and I've enabled it by being too little."

This is advanced English. You're not just understanding words—you're understanding what's NOT being said directly.

When you reach this level, you can hear the hurt, the history, the complicated emotions in simple sentences. That's fluency. That's mastery.
